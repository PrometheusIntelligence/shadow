//! Bulkhead runtime — heavy background computation never runs on the
//! serving runtime.
//!
//! The control-plane leader froze its whole tokio runtime for 73–763 s at a
//! time on 2026-10-01. The named stacks were the relational billing mirror
//! (`spawn_relational_mirror_loop` → `relational::upsert_billing_many` → the
//! guardian SQL engine reloading a 21k-row table per statement) running on
//! `tokio-rt-worker` threads of the one runtime that also serves every HTTP
//! request, gossip round and timer. Two workers at 94 % CPU for minutes, with
//! the service cgroup at its memory.high limit, throttled every allocating
//! thread in the process.
//!
//! Work that is allowed to be slow — projections, index walks, backfills —
//! runs here instead: a second multi-thread runtime with its own small worker
//! pool (`HIVE_BULKHEAD_THREADS`, default 2). A pathological pass can at most
//! pin these threads; the serving runtime's workers, drivers and timers are
//! untouched. The guardian store handles are runtime-agnostic (channels and
//! async mutexes), so the SQL engine runs here unchanged; `tokio::spawn`
//! inside a bulkhead task lands on the bulkhead too (`Handle::current`).
//!
//! The rule: a loop whose per-tick cost grows with the data (rows, keys,
//! tenants) is spawned with [`spawn`], never `tokio::spawn`, and its CPU-heavy
//! step is bounded (chunked, incremental) besides. The runtime stall detector
//! (`runtime_watch`) is the backstop that names whatever still slips through.
