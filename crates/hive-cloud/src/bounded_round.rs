//! A periodic fan-out round that never lasts as long as its slowest target.
//!
//! `join_all` over every target made each round as long as its SLOWEST
//! target: one powered-off seed's dial budget stretched fc-virginia's gossip
//! round to 25-33 s (2026-09-24), and one failing peer's two fallback-ceiling
//! probe samples stretched every health-probe round to ~33 s. A
//! [`BoundedRound`] runs each target in its own task and waits for THIS
//! round's targets only until a deadline. A target still running then is a
//! straggler: it keeps running under its in-flight flag (never dispatched
//! twice at once) and its result lands in whichever later round receives it
//! ([`BoundedRound::begin`] drains those first). Each task reports through a
//! [`Completion`] drop guard, so a task that panics or is dropped still clears
//! its flag. The gossip loop and the health prober both run on it.
//!
//! The deadline alone still let ONE target set the pace of every round: the
//! round waited the full 8 s whenever any target was slower than it, even
//! after that target had missed the deadline on every round for hours
//! (fleet-wide: `collect_p50=8000`, `deadline_hits` on 45 of 47 rounds).
//! [`BoundedRound::collect_leashed`] adds a per-target leash: the round stops
//! waiting for one target after its own, much shorter budget. Parking is NOT
//! cancellation — the task keeps running and its result still lands — so a
//! leash can never cost a peer its dial budget or its discovery fallback.
