# hive-lockdown — block PUBLIC access to the node gateway (TCP 8787, direct
# HTTP/HTTPS-adjacent admin port -- the fleet now serves real 80/443 via the
# DNS migration, ngrok is no longer the path), the iroh-relay metrics/README
# (TCP 9090), and the hive-rt-node workflow-runtime worker ports (TCP 3000,
# 7799-7804 — bound to 0.0.0.0 by the runtime itself with no auth/rate-limiting
# of their own, so they must never be reachable from outside the trusted
# mesh). SSH (22), iroh QUIC (UDP), the iroh-relay (3340), loopback, and the
# peer mesh nodes are all left open, so p2p connectivity, SSH tunnels, and the
# relays keep working. Idempotent; supports both iptables and nftables hosts.
#
# THIS is the fleet's sole firewall. `firewalld` (and any other stock distro
# firewall manager) must be disabled+masked on every node -- it runs its own
# netfilter tables independently of this script's iptables/nft chain, and its
# restrictive default zone silently blocks ports this script explicitly
# allows for peers (live-witnessed on fc-sanjose-2: a fresh Rocky 10 image
# ships firewalld active, whose default zone only opens 80/443/ssh, and it
# blocked the relay/discovery ports from every OTHER fleet node even though
# this script's own rules explicitly permit them).

# STRICT inbound, opt-in per host (`hive_lockdown_strict: true` in the
# inventory drops /etc/hive/lockdown-strict). The table above is policy-ACCEPT:
# it only blocks a short list of known-dangerous ports, so anything else a
# process binds on 0.0.0.0 is reachable by whatever the cloud security group
# lets through -- and Tencent's default group opens EVERY port to the whole
# private address space, which in a shared account includes other people's
# instances. Strict mode is default-DENY on the internet-facing interface only
# (the one carrying the default route): container bridges, litebox TUNs and
# loopback are untouched. It admits established traffic, fleet peers (public
# and private addresses), ICMP, and the ports that are public BY DESIGN:
#   TCP 22 ssh, 80 ACME/redirect, 443 HTTPS, 53 Seer, 5432/6379 the TLS
#   database gateway, 20000-29999 tenant raw ports; UDP 53 Seer, 11204 iroh
#   QUIC mesh, 20000-29999 tenant raw ports.
# A separate table at a later priority, so the fleet table above keeps working
# unchanged and fail2ban's own table (priority -1) still drops banned sources.
